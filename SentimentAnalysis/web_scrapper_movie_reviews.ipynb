I don’t understand the low scores, sounds like something besides the movie/plot is driving them. See this movie, it’s incredible.', 'Wooow this is a baaad movie. Worst lead character in the entire Marvel Universe!', \"Unmemorable movie, there's a little of Top Gun, Green Lantern (that said it all) and worst of all a little of Marvel magic. The protagonist is mono-dimensional and we know how cool, good, fun she is by what other character say about her. She never acts cool, fun or anything else... a big shame!\", 'Aside from the most woodenactor in the world,  the cgi is laughable at times', 'espanol - me desagrada la pilicula por que no tiene la narrativa  del camino del héroe  \\n\\ny después vi en la redes sociales la actriz y me desagrada personal mente (quieren meter ideología de genero y adoctrinar  en todas las películas )', 'Brie Larson put too much of her own obtuse personality into the film', 'Trama completamente forzada. Llega un personajes completamente desconocido a imponerse a las malas. Aparte la actriz es super mega antipatica. tanto en la pelicula como fuera de ella.', \"Yes, I know the anti Cpt Marvel diatribe, but as an original Marvel Comics fan, i found it enjoyable.   A bit too much of today's commentary on society but, all in all, an enjoyable film.\", \"A movie just as good as the other origin stories for characters in the MCU, Brie delivers a good and solid Carol Denvers, with her military mannerisms and her background as a strong woman. I would particularly do it differently about the way she gain her powers, but it's ok, this is a universe where Bruce Banner shoots himself with gama radiation; the hole Kree nuclea very good, love Jude Law, love Gemma Chan. I don't like the way they led Nick Fury's core, I was expecting more of the serious Samuel L. Jackson from the first phase, but it's nothing that destroyed the movie.\", \"Wow I tried watching it expecting it to be rough but I didn't expect it to be THAT bad LOL\", \"The plot is weak. Not a huge fan of this movie. I really wanted to like it but Marvel flopped their first attempt. And that's okay! Please Marvel, give us a GOOD movie next time.\", \"Not the worst MCU movie but it wasn't anywhere close to being a fun, enjoyable Marvel movie. The plot moved slowly and it was predictable. Brie Larson's acting and the writing of her character ended up making a boring dislikable character with little to no character development. On the other hand, Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury once again on screen carried the show as a side character; he made the movie somewhat better than it was. I hated one of the scenes with Nick Fury and a cat... not going to spoil the movie but come on they could have done a lot better. One of the reasons this movie didn't work is because it was trying to be too many things at once, and it couldn't stick the landing.\", 'Totally unlikable main character and some stupid story plot holes, not to mention making a joke of Nick Fury and his injury. Worst movie of them all so far.', 'An utter bore, bereft of creativity or sincerity. The first true signal for Marvel\\'s new direction: warring with fans by sacrificing genuine creativity and entertainment for political messaging and fan-blaming. Brie Larson is another nepotistic Hollywood child, only one with stiff, wooden acting and a massive sense of entitlement. It bleeds through her portrayal. The character is vapid and lifeless. The story is paper thin. The \"villain\" might be the worst in the MCU\\'s notoriously lackluster line up. The movie is garbage, a waste of hundreds of millions of dollars to produce something worse than forgettable. People starve while movies like this are made? Wow, what a hero.', \"This movie was horrible.  Carol was wooden, uninteresting, and went through no personal growth.  The one thing she did do was go from powerful to more powerful without gaining any appreciation for the power she was given.  This movie constantly shoved 'you can't do it because you're a girl' in the audience's face so Carol could repeatedly 'slaaaay qweeeen' without really facing any opposition.  A character needs to get knocked down before they can get up, better as a person as well as power.  Thor lost his hammer, Iron Man was taken captive, Carol...what?  Steals a guy's jacket because he said smile more? \\n\\nPS I am a woman.  Sorry, no male fragility here.\", \"I heard that this movie wasn't well-liked, but it is actually a very fun movie with a likable protagonist and everything. My whole family had a great time. I then found out that apparently, the movie was review-bombed by misogynists and the real polls showed that 80% of viewers enjoyed and recommended it, and it was reflected in a successful box office run. I wish I knew that sooner and didn't avoid it for so long.\", \"For all then noise, this is an average and somewhat stereotypical hero origin story, without much depth. Maybe one difference would be that the lead character is actually not expected to improve herself, but rather realize that she was perfect all along, which is a much less compelling narrative. If you need to waste time and don't have anything else to watch, this is something that can be seen to pass the time, but certainly would not recommend you choose to do so, especially if you have any other options.\", \"Super bland the only fun scenes are when Carol & Nick Fury are having back & fourth discussions & the final battle Carol has in space against the Kree. Carol is probably the biggest Marry Sue to this day since besides the flashbacks where she has to act like a tough girl their is nothing else for us to latch onto her usually whenever a powerful superhero gets introduced we see they have a sensitive side to them like Thor, Superman, Wanda, etc their powers shouldn't be their identity. I do however like how we get the Skrulls introduced into the MCU due to how many interesting stories we can get from them in the future like Secret Invasion which can be interesting to see in live action.\", 'No good movie at all. There was absolutely no character development. It was interesting, to see something of the scrull and Kree but yeah, thats all good, i can say about it.', 'Interesting and with good characters. Its fun to watch', 'was ok just not marvel', 'Mediocre at best.\\n\\nZero character development or growth throughout the movie. Danvers starts her journey unbelievably overpowered and just has to realize how awesome she is. There is a single moment where she is captured and I thought it was going to be a growth moment for her. Cue \"I\\'m just a girl\" background music as she beats the snot out of every skrull with both hands restrained.\\n\\nThere\\'s no stakes, or tension. It becomes obvious very quickly that there is no way that Captain Marvel is in any danger. And I know she\\'s the protagonist and the good guys always win but the writers need to learn how to create tension. CM just strolls from one fight to the next and doesn\\'t even break a sweat. And the way they turn Nick Fury\\'s eye into a joke at the end of the movie was nothing more than a mean spirited jab at a seriously traditional masculine character.', \"I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was funny, and the chemistry was strong. I've re-watched it several times, and I don't get the criticisms. The acting is fine. The chemistry between Larson and Jackson is great. The origin story, though typically scant on rational thought (but need I mention being bitten by a radioactive spider?) still unfolds nicely throughout the movie. And she shows much more than one facial expression. I'm pretty critical, and I don't get the criticism at all. Time well spent.\", \"Horrible film. I don't know which was worse: the horrible script, which thought it was clever and funny, or the horrible acting by the lead actress who had one facial expression throughout. I saw it once at the cinema, wanted to walk out about halfway through due to boredom and never intend to ever watch this piece of trash ever again.\", '★★★★★\\nI watched it for its Visual Effects.', 'The movie focuses more on the messaging rather than character development and fails at both.', \"Probably the lamest MCU movie so far. That's what you get when the main character is so unlikable.\", 'Szemét. Egy utolsó ócska szemét. A fél csillagot a cica miatt kapta nélküle semmit sem érne.', 'Brilliant casting.  One of the best MCU films.', 'Just not that great. passed time but thats about it. watch any other marvel stuff besides early hulk lol', 'Loved it! Great storyline. Loved the characters.', 'Good start to the Marvel franchise.', 'Not a good story, did not have a real part in the Mcu storyline. Was just to make money instead of actually putting a good story and background to it. Could have been done a lot better.', 'Brilliant film, start to finish', \"This movie is actually really good. Sad to see people bomb it with negative reviews just because they don't like Brie Larson (who is an amazing actress) or simply because they don't like to see a woman with power on screen\", 'I thought it was a fun movie the Talos is cool and so is obviously Sam L Jackson the rest of the movie is like eh but still a great and fun time', \"Probably one of the worst movies Marvel has made. Brie Larson's acting was horrible and the story went nowhere. Her origin story was the worst.\", 'Good fun movie nothing too deep but entertaining', \"What makes me mad is I wrote a whole review last time about how I genuinely didn't like the movie and gave it 2 stars. That fact they took it down after I spent the time to write it makes me feel spiteful. I'm dropping it half a star for that.\", \"To be honest, I don't like Brie Larson's Captain Marvel. I hope it's a problem isolated to this movie, maybe it gets better when her stories have participation from other characters in the universe.\", '3 years ago- An origin story rearranged into a sci-fi thriller with slick visuals and a strong back and forth between Sam Jackson and Brie Larson cements Captain Marvel as an effective addition to the MCU.', \"It was enjoyable. It was cool seeing Ronan and Korath again. Didn't like how they made Mar-Vell a woman. 2.5 = Ok\", 'Great Marvel origin story, really liked the chemistry between Larson and Jackson. The twist was unexpected and added another layer of depth. The movie ties into the wider MCU by setting up the Avengers initiative but keeps its own identity, I enjoyed it a lot. Especially Goose!', \"Wastenof time and money.\\nBesides the weak story and mediocre acting by all involved, you can't get around Brie Larsen's wooden performance.  She spends the movie doing her best not to have any facial expression.  It seems her entire goal of the film is to try to reenact Tom Cruise's role in Top Gun, without the charm or likability.  Which is unfortunate becUse, having seen Brie Larson in the TV show Community, I was really looking forward to her taking on this role.\\nShe plays the part with extreme hostility for the character and contempt for the audience.\\nShe seems to double down on her instead  unikeability in her subsequent roles as Capitain Marvel. In the subsequent Avenger movies.\\nGranted, the entire concept of how Capitan Marvel beicame a superhero because in the movie was ridiculous, and how Nick fury got his eye patch was disrespectful to his character, Brie Larson didn't have a ton to work with, her lack of talent made and mediocre movie dreadful.\\nEven if you were to ignore her unpleasant demeanor and self-righteous interviews, the concept of Captain Marvel brings very little to the avengers story. And Miss Larson's betrayal of Captain Marvel nearly ruins the entire franchise. \\nTo summarize, Ms Larson's acting was a d- at best. The remaining cast was a C- to a B+ in parts.  The overall storyline was C, and the special effects were a B.\\nI rank this movie below the second Thor movie.  By far the worst in the Marvel universe.\", 'absolutely horrible movie', \"A pretty good origin movie for Captain Marvel. Really looking forward to a sequel. I don't know why so many people had a problem with Brie Larson's acting. I thought it was great. I guess people didn't like how stern and stoic her character was, although if this were a man I don't think anyone would be complaining about it. I mean she was less serious than say Batman, at least she wasn't completely above smiling.\", \"Some of the MCU movies have been mediocre, Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3, Thor 2, Thor 4, Black Widow.  This is the first movie that actually reduced by appreciation of the Marvel movies.  It just feels they went in an opposite direction from the majority of Marvel movies with this one.  They are there to entertain and mix in little tidbits from the comics that are easily recognizable.  This one just dumbed down the very concept of Captain Marvel and Ms. Marvel into a take on a controversial feminist run of the comics.  It just felt they didn't want us to enjoy the movie, just annoy the audience and burn away some good will.\", 'WTH was MCU/Disney thinking or smoking when they approved this idea?  The Captain Marvel comic is not a good comic, it does not sell well, so I am not sure what made them think THIS was a good idea.  Brie Larson had the same dumb look the whole movie, which was the same in 21 Jump Street.  At least in 21 Jump Street she was suppose portray a dumb teenager, but what was the excuse in this film?  The editing was on par with the rest of high dollar MCU movies.  The writing and direction of the movie was just bad with bad jokes, bad dialog and a very bad plot.', \"If it wasn't wedged between Infinity War and End Game, I would never have seen it. Brie can't act, and she comes across more as a Villain than hero.\", 'Way to powerful, dripping feminism, and not true to the comics.', 'Garbage movie trying to force the idea that women can be as good as men.  Why would you now show the female side for a change?  Something like wonder Woman.', 'very preachy and full of itself. Felt like I was being lectured by the class know-it-all', 'Awful movie. Do not waste your time.', 'The beginning of the end for the MCU right here. An insufferable protagonist leading in a film that really doesn\\'t matter at all to the overall MCU story. She could have popped up in End Game with an extra two lines of dialog and that would have been a better intro than this mess of a movie. \\nDisney Marvel really has no idea how to handle their female heroes when they become the main protagonists as they basically behave in a manner that gets called \"toxic masculinity\" when men do similar things.', \"Simply awful I've never been so disappointed with a characters development before.\", 'Aunque no soy muy fan de las películas de superhéroes, esta claro que desentona con el resto de películas, tiene contradicciones constantes con las otras obras y más que entretener busca un discurso político que esta de moda los últimos años.

No.', 'Main actor failed her performance, movie was generic and predictable.', 'A brainless female empowerment hero movie. It only looks good, but its neither smart or funny. There is no emotion behind tha character.', \"The first MCU film with a female lead. The plot is interesting and the conflict between Kree and Skrull can recall the events of colonization that took place in history. There is a lot of girlpower in the film which at times makes the protagonist's character a bit unsympathetic. Very nice is instead Nick Fury who comes up with funny gags. Although audiences hated this film, I find it enjoyable and entertaining.\", 'I would have like to have seen the original male protagonist before being introduced to the female version as per original comic books. I believe the storyline could have been a little bit different as well.', 'La peor película del MCU. Panfletazo feminista...', 'Boring and the main actress was so bland. No challenges to overcome, boring.', 'Simply a mess.\\n\\nBad writing, forced social messaging pushing the current female power agenda.\\n\\nA character that is not well liked in comic books was a bad idea, and making her an overpowered Mary Sue!!\\n\\nThe marvel movie universe really stopped after \"endgame\" now it\\'s just about social justice forced into movies and shows.', 'Stoic acting and predictible plot filled with common feminist tropes and unrealistic character responses.', 'Its not that the movie is terrible, its just not good. Many movies get away with this by being funny in how bad the movie is but this is not that. The movie is about one step away from being terrible though. \\n\\nThe plot premise is good enough but falls flat. Never flat. Then you have Disney making a character, designed to be very over powered as a social commentary and just roll with it like it just makes sense. She is really the only super hero they didnt lower the power of and it really shows how desperate they tried to make the character awesome. \\n\\nThen the acting also fell very flat. Yes yes, we all know the main actress is bad. Her social media posts and all that prove she is not a good person and Disney, in their time of pushing current social commentary HARD, mixing her into the mix was a recipe for disaster just waiting to happen and the reviews here show that. \\n\\nLike I said... its not a good movie but it isnt terrible. I would say easily the worst though of all the Marvel movies and shows. How this got a second movie, I will never know. It wasnt any better either.

I really liked the dynamic between Fury and Danvers, the plot twist did catch me by surprise, and the action was pretty solid but a lot of the characters felt kinda stale and 2 Dimensional and didn't help the plot very much but this film in my opinion doesn't deserve as much hate as it gets or has gotten.\", 'The must forgettable movie in the whole franchise with my most hated character in it.

The reveal of the true villains is fun, and Ben Mendelsohn's Talos is funny and entertaining. The return of Ronin to the screen had potential, but was cut short and his role was minimal. Jude Law's Yon-Rogg is un-compelling, although seeing him get blasted by Captain Marvel is strangely satisfying.

Emily Blunt would have been a much better choice, but if the producers thought she was too old they could have gone with Natalie Dormer, who looks exactly like the comic book drawing.  If there was any saving grace for the movie it was the fish out of water story taking place in the 1990's.  Sadly this part of the story is short and all too fleeting.

And also, she is way too overpowered for my liking, especially toward the end of the movie. The villain is one of the most forgettable in the whole of MCU, that I can't even remember his name minutes after I watched it. Samuel L.

Halfway thru i kind of figured out what was going on but by then I lost hope of understanding the overall plot and only focused on the action scene by scene. It took the end of the movie to completely spell it out for me to understand what i just watched.', 'waste of time and a waste of actors that could be used in a better engaging feminist film.', 'First the good stuff: 1. Samuel L. Jackson: He played a more softened Nick Fury, but very much \"agent coulson prior avengers\" like, with a lot of attitude, sarcastic humor and less serious. Also the de-aging is becoming so good, that you wouldnt even be able to notice it even if you really looked. His character was very well done on script and screen.\\n\\n2. Some of the action: The space battle stuff etc. was very well done. the special effects team did an amazing job at this movie. nothing felt or looked fake. kudos!\\n\\n3. Surprise surprise: the story. From the trailers you would not be able to predict this but the story is actually really interesting. The way they introduce her past was very originally done. The way she remembers things through different ways was clever.. very clever even, because it doesnt make her past like an obstacle you first gotta go through.. it added to the story while adding to her character. Also multiple twist and 1 big one that even got me thinking for a while.\\n\\n4. Ben Mendelson: really impressive job. very layered surpringsly and stand out in my books. the acting is general was very good\\n\\nthe bad:\\n\\n1. It misses spectacle... and a standout moment. in thor 3 for example; you had the intro scene, and the end scene which were big standout moments and a manifestation of thor\\'s powers. i feel you didnt get that in this movie.\\n\\n2. Like I said the story was great, the execution a.k.a. the screenplay/script lacked... they had such great storypoints, but they were all done so quickly and those moments lacked emotion. the friendship between carol and her friend didnt feel real. she seemed to have a more genuine relationship with her kid rather than with her and that bothered me a bit, since they seemed all buddy buddy in the past and even during some moments in the film where i was like; \"but you didnt deserve that yet...\" Ben\\'s character had a more emotional impact on me than carol... yikes!! (and i dont mean that in a killmonger-t\\'challa kind of way)\\n\\n3. some of the action again: some action just wasn\\'t good. there is a moment she is fighting the skrull(the moment she yells at the skrull in the trailer) and that whole fighting sequence was horribly filmed and choreographed... which is weird, because she another scene where she is fighting the skrull in the film and then the action seemed way better filmed.\\n\\nAll in all, the film was good. nothing more and nothing less. i missed an emotional attachment to the main character. I felt like i still didnt know her after the film, and i think that\\'s because they tried to give her a certain personality that just didnt fit the film. she was supposed to be a bit arrogant, but i wouldve loved to see more vulnerablity in a woman that is the STRONGEST creature in the world and they made me believe that btw. she come across as amazingly powerfull at one point in the film. believe me! Wonderwoman\\'s vulnerability and her femine side me fall in love with the character and they stripped that away fromm carol, and basically made her less relatable.\\n\\n I\\'s definitely a good time in the theatre and some of the scenes are quite the spectacle and i loved the shock and awe that some scenes provided. especially the way she got her powers. Go see it.', \"Below-par for the MCU. Powerful women in cinema have rocked for decades, and don't need to be so obvious.\", 'This is one of the worst marvel movies. You can clearly see that this wasnt made by someone who wanted to tell an amazing story but by someone who wantend to make money and push there politic agenda into the marvel universe. The Story is okay and the setup is good. But the execution is unbelivalby bad. The cat had the most chacater developpment. And the worst thing is how silly they wanted to make Nick Fury. It just doesnt sits right with me how he his character just always followed the main character and was basicly just there so people could have a familiar face. All in all its a shit movie dont watch it.', \"There's just not enough female heroes like this. Great story, love the twist and the assumptions we make being challenged.\", \"As a huge fan of Captain Marvel from her Ms. Marvel days I loved this MCU adaptation. Brie Larson did a great job getting her personality down. Can't wait to see more of her in the MCU.\", \"I've never seen someone with less charisma on screen than Brie Larson, whose acting was so hollow in this film. The character is never developed into someone you even care about and the story just isn't very interesting.  I love Samuel Jackson and even he couldn't save this film. This is the worse Marvel movie I have seen so far.\", 'such a good flick. she is so strong. cant wait to watch this character grow', \"Here's the odd thing: the story is actually pretty interesting. What killed this movie was Brie Larson. She just comes across as unlikeable. And an unlikeable hero is no bueno in a superhero movie. If a different actress was cast as Captain Marvel, this film would feel really different—a much more positive vibe. We've seen protagonists with memory issues about their past in other movies (like Jason Bourne) so it's not like heroes with amnesia have to be portrayed the way Larson does it. But she does it in a way that's just no fun. So we don't root for Carol Danvers like we did for Jason Bourne.\", 'I rewatched the movie yesterday and it was really entertaining, a good Marvel movie at its best']\n"
